== Description ==

WP-Mail-Validator is an anti-spam plugin. It provides mail-address validation in 5 ways:

1. syntax of mail-addresses
2. mailserver host
3. mx-record of mailserver
4. user-defined blacklist
5. trashmail services

Once the plugin identifies a mail-address to be non existing on the mailserver or being on the blacklist or
from trashmail service, any comment being made is moved to the spam area awaiting moderation from the blog owner.

== Installation ==

1. Upload and unzip folder to `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
